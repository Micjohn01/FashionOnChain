# FashionStoreOnChain

## Overview

The **FashionStoreOnChain** is a decentralized on-chain fashion store implemented as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows the store owner to add products, update them, sell them to customers, process refunds, and manage the contractâ€™s Ether balance securely. The contract enforces several constraints such as maximum price and quantity, ensures accurate payment and refunds, and allows only the owner to manage products.

## Features

**Add Products:** The owner can add new products with a name, price, and quantity.

**Update Products:** The owner can update the price and quantity of existing products.

**Purchase Products:** Users can purchase available products by sending Ether equivalent to the product price.

**Refunds:** Users can request a refund for products they have purchased, and their Ether will be returned.

**Owner-Only Functions:** Only the contract owner can add, update products, and withdraw funds.

**Ether Withdrawal:** The contract owner can withdraw the store's accumulated Ether.

## Usage

**Deployment**

Deploy the contract using Remix or any Ethereum development framework such as Hardhat or Truffle. The contract's constructor automatically assigns the deployer's address as the owner.

**Interaction**

***Adding a Product***

To add a product, the owner must call the addProduct function with the product's name, price, and quantity. The price is specified in Wei (1 Ether = 10^18 Wei).

***Updating a Product***

The owner can update a product's price and quantity using the updateProduct function. Only active products can be updated.

***Purchasing a Product***

Customers can purchase products by calling purchaseProduct and sending the required amount of Ether. If the customer sends more Ether than required, the excess is refunded.

***Requesting a Refund***

Customers can request refunds for products they have purchased using the refundProduct function, provided they have not exceeded their purchase limit.

***Withdrawing Funds***

The owner can withdraw the contract's Ether balance using the withdrawFunds function.
